I used this program to make 200 tickets for my personal use. 

This sample created 20 tickets with my input. You can input any arbitrarily large number in line 18.
The created tickets go in the Tickets folder.
Sample.png is the template file.
Font.ttf is the font for the numbers.
On Line 24 I give it the pixel coordinates of all the blank points of my first 
ticket (top left on of the sample.png)

Just run the script and it will populate the Tickets folder with the desired tickets.

When I used this to print 200 tickets for my event, everything went smoothly and 
duplicate tickets were not a problem as it is all done very randomly.
